# Workflow names are optional, but should be provided.
# They are displayed on GitHub when the action is run.
name: Hello world ✨

# The `on` property configures the events that will trigger the workflow.
# In our case we want it to run when the `pull_request` event is triggered.
# In short, that means that the workflow will run when a pull request is
# either opened or updated (but not renamed or labeled – code needs to
# be changed).
on:
  - pull_request

# Jobs are what actually do the work. We can add as many jobs as we want.
# These will be run in parallel.
